                <p>The kerfuffle spread far and wide in May 2021 and began with a harmless farmer in the Belgian town of Erquelinnes. Naively moving the 300-pound historic monument out of the way of his tractor, the man had unwittingly expanded Belgium’s territory by 10,000 square feet.
                    He had no idea the Erquelinnes border stone had been placed there following the defeat of Napoleon or served as a geopolitical marker. Nor had he anticipated the international fiasco his actions would spawn after a local history buff noticed the alteration — and the French caught wind of it.</p>

                <p>Over the years, 38-year-old David Werking curated an impressive collection of DVDs and VHS tapes. While he could be described as a movie buff, that horde of antiquated formats exclusively consisted of porn. But when his parents threw it away after he left it in their basement, he sued them them.
                    While Beth and Paul Werking loved their son, the couple was fed up with his extensive library of lust. This was not a matter of a few magazines and films, but a trove of 400 cassettes and 1,600 DVDS alongside a litany of sex toys.</p>

                <p>Whether searching for adventure, distant lands, or on the hunt for mythical beasts, humankind has taken to sea for millennia. While naval officers train to control, regulate, and defend territory, few train how to deal with monsters, as one group of Italian service members discovered this year.
                    At least, that’s what they believed when they fished a bizarre, pig-faced creature out of the waters on Sept. 3, 2021. Stationed on the Italian island of Elba near Tuscany, they’d spotted a lifeless animal floating in the Mediterranean — and stood aghast upon bringing it aboard.</p>

                <p>We’ve all seen examples of life imitating art, but none are quite as stark as a volcanic crystal resembling Sesame Street‘s Cookie Monster. Remarkably, that’s exactly what geologist Lucas Fassari dug from the cavities of Brazil’s Rio Grande do Sul region in November 2020.
                    With a blue-hued center and three openings defining the eyes and a mouth, the stone was a dead ringer for the sugar-craving puppet. While it’s unclear how the quartz-laden rock fell into Mike Bowers’ hands, the U.S. geologist received five offers for $10,000 from potential buyers.</p>

                <p>After decades as an unwavering AT&T customer, 90-year-old Aaron Epstein had enough. Millions of people around him enjoyed high-speed internet, but Epstein’s neighborhood of North Hollywood, California, however, was still stuck with AT&T’s sluggish service. So he took a drastic measure.
                    Carefully crafting a frank but cordial letter, Epstein purchased a $10,000, quarter-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal to publicly address AT&T’s CEO, John T. Stankey.</p>
